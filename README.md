### OBJ2000 (Object oriented programming 2)

This is a repo consisting of the small classes as defined in the course book _Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures_ by _Y. Daniel Liang_, with loads of comments (in mostly Norwegian mind you) for my own learning's sake.

__Objectives__
- To write Java programs to perform simple calculations
- To obtain input from the console using the `Scanner`class
- To use identifiers to name variables, constants, methods, and classes
- To use variables to store data
- To program with assignment statements and assignment expressions
- To use constants to store permanent data
- To name classes, methods, variables, and constants by following their naming conventions
- To explore Java numeric primitive data types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float` and `double`
- To read a `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float` or `double` value from the keyboard
- To perform operations using operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`
- To perform exponent operations using `Math.pow(a, b)`
- To write integer literals, floating-point literals, and literals in scientific notation
- To use JShell to quickly test Java code
- To write and evaluate numeric expressions
- To obtain current system time using `System.currentTimeMillis()`
- To use augmented assignnment operators
- To distinguish between postincrement and preincrement and between postdecrement and predecrement
- To cast the value of one type to another type
- To describe the software development process and apply it to develop the loan payment program
- To write a program that converts a large amount of money into smaller units
- To avoid common errors and pitfalls in elementary programming

#### Section classes

The __section__ classes are programming exercises. These come after each chapter, instead of during the chapters as the __listing__ classes does.
`*` and `**` denotes heightened difficulty according to the course book editors.
