# Liang-Chapter-2

[Go here for the newest branch](https://github.com/Scandiking/Liang-Chapter-2/tree/master)

So, this is a repo consisting of the programs from _Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures_ by _Y. Daniel Liang_ featuring lots of comments for my own learing's sake. 

Where's the repo for the chapter 1 java classes? 
There aren't any. Because they are way too basic. It's in the league of 

<pre>
```java 
    public class ShowSyntaxErrors {
        public static main(String[] args) {  
            System.out.println("Welcome to Java);
        }
    }  
``` </pre>

> "What's wrong here?"

...and I found that wasn't really anything to upload to GitHub.
