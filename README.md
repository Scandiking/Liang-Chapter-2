This is a repo consisting of the small classes as defined in the course book _Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures_ by _Y. Daniel Liang_, with loads of comments (in mostly Norwegian mind you) for my own learning's sake.

The __section__ classes are programming exercises. These come after each chapter, instead of during the chapters as the __listing__ classes does.
